# House Prices Prediction

This is a simple project where I try to predict house prices using Python and machine learning.  
The data comes from the Kaggle competition: [House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

---

## What is inside
- `house_prediction.ipynb` – my Jupyter Notebook with all the code
- `submission.csv` – the file with predictions that can be uploaded to Kaggle

---

## What I used
- **Pandas / NumPy** for working with the data
- **Scikit-Learn** for splitting the data and evaluation
- **XGBoost** to build the prediction model

## How to run
1. Download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MAREKKSOK/house-prices.git
